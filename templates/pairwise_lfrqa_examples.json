        "query": "difference between publicly and publically.",
        "response_1": "Both 'publicly' and 'publically' bear no difference in meaning, as they are essentially alternative spellings of the same concept. Publicly is more widely used, but the existence of 'publically' in reputable sources like the OED means it cannot be dismissed as simply incorrect. Some opinions hold that 'publicly' is the older irregular form, still preached by a lot of grammars, and 'publically,' on the other hand, is the newer and regular form.",
        "response_2": "There is no difference in meaning between 'publicly' and 'publically'; they are alternative spellings of the same word.",
        "label": "1",
        "thinking": "Both <answer 1> and <answer 2> are truthful. However, <answer 1> provides more truthful information as the context to compare the two terms. Therefore, <answer 1> is better."

        "response_1": "Historical European and American cooks used egg whites for making egg white omelettes and egg white pasta, as well as for stiffening clothing, similar to how starch is used today.",
        "response_2": "Egg whites have found their place in various non-culinary applications throughout history, such as in the clarification of beer and wine, in the conservation of books through bookbinding and gilding, and in makeup as an ancient form of nail polish.\nThey were also utilized historically as a stiffening agent for clothing, similar to how starch is used today.\nThe culinary landscape was not left untouched, with egg whites making their way into recipes for omelettes and pastas as early as the 15th century.",
        "label": "2",
        "thinking": "Both <answer 1> and <answer 2> provide several usages of egg whites for European/American cooks. <answer 2> clearly provides more options with fully explained details. Therefore, <answer 2> is better."

        "query": "should utf-16 be considered harmful?",
        "response_1": "The question of whether UTF-16 should be considered harmful is subject to differing opinions. One perspective suggests that UTF-16 is harmful due to a historical misconception about character encoding and recommends UTF-8 as the superior choice for various text interfaces. Another viewpoint argues that UTF-16 is not inherently harmful, emphasizing its utility in specific scenarios where it serves as a compromise between simplicity and compactness. The choice between UTF-16 and other encodings like UTF-8 depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as compatibility with ASCII or the need to efficiently encode certain character sets.",
        "response_2": "UTF-16 should not be considered harmful.\nHowever, contrasting views argue that UTF-16 should indeed be considered harmful.\nSome argue that the very reason UTF-16 exists is because some time ago there used to be a misguided belief that WideChar is going to be what UCS-4 now is.\nAdditionally, the harmfulness of UTF-16 is tied to issues with exercising code.",
        "label": "0",
        "thinking": "Both <answer 1> and <answer 2> reconcile the two conflicting views with detailed explanation. I am not sure which one is better."
